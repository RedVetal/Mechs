    <h1>Privacy Policy — HeavyFrame: Desert Siege (Android game)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-11-14</p>

    <p>
      This privacy policy explains how the Android game <strong>HeavyFrame: Desert Siege</strong> (the “Game”)
      handles information. The Game is developed by an individual developer (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not run our own analytics, user accounts, cloud saves, or in‑app purchases.</li>
      <li>The Game shows ads using the <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)</strong>.</li>
      <li>AdMob may collect and share certain device and usage data for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention.</li>
      <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data we do not collect directly</h2>
    <p>
      The Game itself does not ask you to register, enter a name or email, create an account,
      or upload any user‑generated content. We do not operate our own backend servers for this Game
      and we do not directly store personal data about players.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising and Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>
      The Game uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK to display banner ads and interstitial ads.
      This SDK is provided by Google and may collect and share data as described in Google’s
      documentation and privacy policies.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Google’s public documentation for the Google Mobile Ads SDK, the SDK may
      automatically collect and share the following types of data for advertising, analytics,
      and fraud prevention purposes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>IP address</strong> (used to estimate the general/approximate location of the device).</li>
      <li><strong>User product interactions</strong> (for example, app launches, taps, and views of in‑game ads).</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostic information</strong> (for example, crash logs, performance, energy usage).</li>
      <li><strong>Device and account identifiers</strong>, including the Android advertising ID (Advertising ID) and app‑specific IDs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is handled by Google and its partners to show and measure ads, improve their systems,
      and protect against invalid activity. Google states that this data is encrypted in transit.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising ID and choices</h2>
    <p>
      The Game uses the Android <strong>Advertising ID</strong>. This identifier is provided by Google Play services and
      can be reset or removed by the user in the Android system settings. If you reset or remove this ID,
      Google and its partners should use the new ID (or stop using the old one) according to Google’s policies.
    </p>

    <p>
      On many devices you can also limit or turn off personalized advertising in the system settings
      (for example, “Ads” / “Advertising” / “Delete Advertising ID” or similar, depending on device and OS version).
    </p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Because we use AdMob, some data described above is sent from your device directly to Google and its
      advertising partners. We do not receive detailed profiles of individual users from Google.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not sell personal data and we do not share player data with other third parties outside of
      the advertising services mentioned in this policy, except where required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Game is intended for users aged 13 and over and is not primarily directed at children.
      If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has used the Game in a way that
      results in personal data being collected, you may contact us using the email below.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on Google’s infrastructure to securely transmit and store the data handled by AdMob.
      As with any online service, we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we aim to integrate only
      widely used, reputable SDKs and to keep the Game updated.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights and contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this policy or about how the Game interacts with Google Mobile Ads,
      you can contact the developer at:
    </p>
    <p>
      Email: <a href="mailto:redvetal@gmail.com">redvetal@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Requests related to Google’s own use of data (for example, access, correction, or deletion of data
      held by Google) should be directed to Google, as we do not control their systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example when we add new features or
      change SDKs. The most recent version will always be available at this URL, with an updated
      “Effective date”. Significant changes may also be mentioned in the Game’s release notes.
